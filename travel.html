			Glacier Gorge Trailhead to Sky Pond in Rocky Mountain National Park is considered one of the most scenic hikes in the United States.  The 6 hr hike at elevation sees less traffic than nearby Bear Lake due to its physical demands.  It also blurs the line between hiking and mountineering as scrambling up Timberline Falls seperates the determined from the faint of heart.

			RMNP is currently using a timed entry system to reduce crowds.  I was able to score a Glacier Basin Campground reservation which made it an easy 10 minute drive to the trailhead.  Arriving at 4:30AM, the lot was already filling up fast.  Enter the park before 5AM to avoid the entry fee.

			The hike totals about 10 miles with +1700' of elevation gain.  I was able to use the AllTrails app for navigation and signs are posted at junctions.  Despite that, I did see people turning around after a wrong turn.  Those who continue are treated to picturesque Lake of Glass.

			Depending on the time of year, as you increase in elevation, there are varying amounts of snow on the trail.  Microspikes are recommended and can be rented from <a href="https://www.estesparkmountainshop.com/summer-rentals">Mountain Shop in Estes Park.</a><br><br>The only difficult part is just before Timberline Falls.  It becomes steep and icey.  Then you have to scramble up a waterfall which in my opinion is the best part of the hike.  It's somewhat dangerous because the path takes you directly into the wet rocks and you'll be using your hands to scramble up that section.  It's not for everyone and some people turn around here.

While I was 100% sure footed on snow, my friend wore only running shoes and was constantly struggling to keep balance.

			The Sharkstooth marks the top of Sky Pond.<br><br>Note that coming back down Timberline Falls and especially, the steep, icey part is more dangerous than going up.  Some people slide down the snow on their butt.  However, there are rocks popping out and it's a steep, fast slide which is hard to control.  With that said, Good Luck.  I thought it was fun, but some people run the risk of injury depending on their physical capabilities.
